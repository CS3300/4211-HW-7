WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net TXN/PHYSICAL/clk_inv is
   sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE
   pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net CONTROL<13> is sourced by a
   combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net TXN/data_to_send_not0001 is
   sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE
   pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   TXN/return_cursor_home_done_not0001 is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This
   is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data
   into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:774 - Unexpected DCM configuration. CLKOUT_PHASE_SHIFT
   is not configured VARIABLE for comp CLK_DIV/DCM_SP_INST. The PSEN pin is
   connected to an active signal. The PSEN pin should be connected to GND to
   guarantee the expected operation.
DRC detected 0 errors and 5 warnings.  Please see the previously displayed
