Mapping design into LUTs...
WARNING:LIT:176 - Clock buffer is designated to drive clock loads. BUFGMUX
   symbol "physical_group_CLKDV_OUT/CLK_DIV/CLKDV_BUFG_INST" (output
   signal=CLKDV_OUT) has a mix of clock and non-clock loads. The non-clock loads
   are:
   Pin I0 of TXN/PHYSICAL/clk_inv1_INV_0
   Pin D of ila/U0/I_TQ0.G_TW[21].U_TQ
Running directed packing...
WARNING:Pack:266 - The function generator XST_GND failed to merge with F5
   multiplexer data_to_write_mux0000<126>11_f5.  There is a conflict for the
   FXMUX.  The design will exhibit suboptimal timing.
WARNING:Pack:266 - The function generator XST_GND failed to merge with F5
   multiplexer SPI_FLASH/spimosi_mux000034_f5.  There is more than one F5MUX. 
   The design will exhibit suboptimal timing.
WARNING:Pack:266 - The function generator XST_GND failed to merge with F5
   multiplexer display_counter_mux0000<2>_SW0_f5.  There is more than one F5MUX.
    The design will exhibit suboptimal timing.

WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net TXN/PHYSICAL/clk_inv is
   sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE
   pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net CONTROL<13> is sourced by a
   combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:774 - Unexpected DCM configuration. CLKOUT_PHASE_SHIFT
   is not configured VARIABLE for comp CLK_DIV/DCM_SP_INST. The PSEN pin is
   connected to an active signal. The PSEN pin should be connected to GND to
   guarantee the expected operation.

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.
